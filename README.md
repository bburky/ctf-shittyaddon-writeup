# Capture The Flag Shitty Add-On Writeup

This is a writeup for the [Capture The Flag Shitty Add-On](https://blog.wokwi.com/capture-the-flag-shitty-add-on/) CTF by Uri Shaked. This was a hardware CTF involving an ATTiny85. My solution was witten inside an IPython notebook and tested with a Raspberry Pi 2 and a Digispark clone board.

The notebook may be viewed online at <https://bburky.com/ctf-shittyaddon-writeup/>.
