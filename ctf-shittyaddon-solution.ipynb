    "This IPython notebook is a solution for the [Capture The Flag Shitty Add-On](https://blog.wokwi.com/capture-the-flag-shitty-add-on/) by Uri Shaked. Read the blog post for full details of the CTF challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this CTF we have an ATTiny85 accessible over I²C. The full source code for the firmware is available on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a number of milestones to meet:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Turn on the LED**](#Turn-on-the-LED) — Hopefully self-explanatory?\n",
    "2. [**The Secret Flag**](#The-Secret-Flag) — Find a string of text in memory.\n",
    "3. [**Blinking Rootkit**](#Blinking-Rootkit) — Make a the LED blink without additional I²C communication.\n",

    "* [Blog post and CTF description](https://blog.wokwi.com/capture-the-flag-shitty-add-on/)\n",
    "* [`ctf-firmware.ino` source for the CTF](https://github.com/urish/ctf-shittyaddon/blob/master/ctf-firmware/ctf-firmware.ino)\n",
    "* [ATtiny8x Datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested this solution with a Raspberry Pi 2 directly connected to a Digispark clone (an ATtiny85 board). The \"5v\" input of the Digispark was powered from the Pi's 3.3v pin to ensure the Digsparks's outputs safely operate at 3.3v. The [`ctf-firmware-1.0.0.hex`](https://github.com/urish/ctf-shittyaddon/releases/tag/1.0.0) file was flashed to the Digispark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pi must have I²C and SPI enabled in `/boot/config.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    dtparam=i2c_arm=on,i2c_arm_baudrate=10000\n",
    "    dtparam=spi=on\n",
    "  \n",
    "I set the I²C baud rate to 10kHz to avoid errors. I think this may be due the fact that Raspberry Pis [don't support clock stretching](http://www.advamation.com/knowhow/raspberrypi/rpi-i2c-bug.html) but the [ATtiny85 and the TinyWire library may allow it](https://github.com/lucullusTheOnly/TinyWire/issues/1). In other words, the slow ATtiny85 may not send all the data fast enough with the Pi's default 100kHz baud rate, set it to something slow like 10kHz. If you don't change the baud rate you will sometimes get \"OSError: [Errno 121] Remote I/O error\" and may see corrupted/failed reads or writes. At first I had 40kHz working, but it quit working some reason. I found 10kHz to be completely stable, but annoyingly slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, if the AVR ISP interface is connected to the Pi's SPI pins the Digispark can be flashed directly from the Pi with `avrdude`'s linuxspi protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "    avrdude -v -pattiny85 -clinuxspi -b14400 -P /dev/spidev0.0 -U flash:w:ctf-firmware-1.0.0.hex \n",
    "    avrdude -v -pattiny85 -clinuxspi -b14400 -P /dev/spidev0.0 -Uefuse:w:0xfe:m -Uhfuse:w:0xdf:m -Ulfuse:w:0xe2:m\n",
    "    \n",
    "Don't connect the Pi to the Digispark's I²C and SPI at the same time, they share pins and things will go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a photo of my Digispark connected to my Pi. The yellow and green wires connect I²C from the Pi to the Digispark. The disconnected SPI wires can be temporarily connected to reflash the Digispark. The black wire from pin 25 of the Pi is used by `avrdude` for reset. And with Wi-Fi on the Pi I can walk around with my laptop and CTF with ease.\n",

    "\n",
    "## I²C Read/Write\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the source code for the CTF and you will find `onI2CReceive()` and `onI2CRequest()` handling I²C communication. During `setup()` the I²C address is configured to 0x23 and these functions are registered to run on receving and on request for I²C data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On an I²C read, two bytes are returned by the firmware: the lower byte of the 16-bit `target` address and the byte at that adddress in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing, the first byte is used to set lower byte of the `target` address. The upper byte is always set to zero because only one byte is being written to a `uint16_t` sized variable. The remainder of the bytes are written to memory sequentially, starting at the `target` pointer address.\n",
    "\n",
    "A write with zero data bytes may be performed before a read to set the target address of the read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a pair of `i2c_write()` and `i2c_read()` functions. These functions also track the full 16-byte target address in a `current_target` global variable."

I/O Registers within the address range 0x00 - 0x1F are directly bit-accessible using the SBI and CBI instructions. In these registers, the value of single bits can be checked by using the SBIS and SBIC instructions. Refer to the instruction set section for more details. When using the I/O specific commands IN and OUT, the I/O addresses 0x00 - 0x3F must be used. When addressing I/O Registers as data space using LD and ST instructions, 0x20 must be added to these addresses. \n",
